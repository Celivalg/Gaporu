    The word Gaporu comes from the initials of the name of the members of our group. This project aspires to create a rendering program for 3D fractals using ray-marching. Fractals have always been a fascination for mathematicians and artists, their beauty and complexity emerges from a usually simple formula or pattern. This program would allow for a deeper view into these shapes. 
 Ray-marching is a rendering technique similar to ray-tracing but optimised for simple shapes. As a fractal is just a repetition of simple shapes, ray-marching allows for a huge optimisation in rendering fractals. 

 Even though ray-marching allows us to considerably reduce the computing time of our program, the amount of floating-points calculations that has to be done in order to render an image is still huge. A typical CPU will probably take a long time to render a single image, let alone a video. Hence why we decided to utilise the strong floating point calculation efficiency of the GPUs (Graphical Processing Units) along with their capabilities for parallelism. Ideally, we would like for the program to run in real-time, but as this is a big task and although we aim for it, we won't expect it to.

 For the user to interact with our program, we would like to have a GUI that would allow for camera movement and settings for the fractal to view. If the fractals cannot be rendered in real-time, we could implement a path saving for the camera with a dummy object as the fractal, and then let the program render a video.<br>

<h4>Gaurav Lokwani</h4> I got interest in Computer Science when I was in class 10th and when I completed my 12th grade I decided to join EPITA which is one of the well known colleges for Computer Science and now I further decide to continue in this field. I am particularly amused by Cyber Security and I decide to pursue my career in this area.<br>

<h4>Alexandre Poirier-Coutansais</h4> I am a twenty year old student at EPITA, I have worked on four school projects throughout my stay at EPITA in the last two and a half year. I have some strong passions in algorithmics and software engineering in general, I chose the ISN option in my last year in Lyc√©e and developed my first neural network there in C++. It wasn't my first experience in programming as I have been working on different small projects since I was 13-14 years old. I have a relatively strong knowledge in C, C++, C\# and Python, I have also played with PHP, Javascript, Java Rust although I don't quite feel confident in these languages yet. I also play a lot with scripting languages such as Bash and Lua. I plan to do my career in algorithmic research or in software engineering, for the latter, hopefully as a System developer as network isn't really my type of thing. I have a big side project on which I am working on besides this project which is focused in simulating the gravitational lensing effect around black holes as accurately as possible. This school project will help me a lot towards this side project as some of the experience I was missing for this latter project will be present in this school project. I am really looking forward to this project and I am happy to be part of it.<br>


<h4>Martin Ruhlmann</h4>I am a twenty year old student at EPITA. After two projects during the two past semesters I am very happy to study on ray marching and 3D fractals. When Alexandre introduced me to ray-marching programs I thought it could be an interesting way to study on 3D. I think that 3D fractals are an interesting way to study mathematics and associate it with a visual representation in such a mesmerizing way.<br>
