    I am satisfied with the progress we did in the project as of now because we are comparatively ahead in our work and this time we did it very fast. I did the part of the website, but since this project is all about learning, instead of using a template or using sphinx to document it, I prefer to code it myself and that's how I learned to code in HTML/CSS.<br>

    I am really happy how well the project turned out for the first defense, we are ahead of schedule and this was a bit unexpected as I though this project would have been a larger endeavour than what it is. I am confident that we will be able to achieve our goals, and also impatient to see the final result. Learning OpenCL has proven to be an enriching experience, as I now understand much more about how GPUs work and still expect to learn much more. This project has been made easy to work on, partially thanks to the directory structure, compared to other school projects through the last few years, which has been a huge help in development.<br>

    The Computer Science, in its entirety, interest me since I was 12 years old
although my parents don’t work at all in this sector. I tried to learn this
by myself with all the resources I can have like Internet mostly, but I didn’t
really know where to start, my goal wasn’t clear, so I learned a lot of different
things. I was looking at first how to create a website. I read some articles,
watched videos on Youtube and I finally bought an online course on Udemy
“How to create your first website”.
It explained a lot of things, from the real basis of HTML to things more
advanced like PHP, MySQL, jQuery and others. It offers also an alternative
of website with WordPress. It ends with a great project of a Website and an
online CV: I liked this.
Then, I was wondering how everything about Informatique works: how
people can communicate each other, how the computer transform a signal
onto what we have on the screen. . . and after that I started to interest myself
with the Ethical Hacking because I read that there are a lot of problems with malicious people who try to take information to their personal interest (like
money mostly). I like computer security because it is always a challenge to
find new vulnerabilities.
And before coming to EPITA, I bought an online course on Linux and
discover that it is very different than Windows or IOS. There is more control
on your computer, you know what you are doing. Even if it takes a lot of
times to grasp. And this initiative helped me during programming courses
with the school.
So, I am very curious in generally, especially on the Computer Science, and
I enjoy participate to project, alone or with other people and this project is
very interesting for me because I didn’t know how to code in C and I never cre-
ate a video games before. I learned a lot of things fast by creating something
new without any real help from a mentor. We must handle some difficulties
and problems that can happen at the wrong moment, I like this feeling of
pression, it enables me to do things faster than in a normal situation. The
trust in your partner is a key to success I think, and based on it, we all have
different responsibilities that we must take care and makes things happened.<br>
